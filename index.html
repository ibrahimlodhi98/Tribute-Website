                <H1>Khan Research Laboratories and atomic bomb program</H1>

                <p>In April 1976, Khan joined the atomic bomb program and became part of 
                the enrichment division, initially collaborating with Khalil Qureshi – a 
                physical chemist.[56]: 62–63  Calculations performed by him were valuable 
                contributions to centrifuges and a vital link to nuclear weapon research, 
                but continue to push for his ideas for feasibility of weapon-grade uranium 
                even though it had a low priority, with most efforts still aimed to 
                produce military-grade plutonium.[53]: 73–74 [56] Because of his interest 
                in uranium metallurgy and his frustration at having been passed over for 
                director of the uranium division (the job was instead given to Bashiruddin
                Mahmood), Khan refused to engage in further calculations and caused 
                tensions with other researchers.[40]: 147–148  Khan became highly 
                unsatisfied and bored with the research led by Mahmood – finally, he 
                submitted a critical report to Bhutto, in which he explained that the 
                "enrichment program" was nowhere near success.</p>
